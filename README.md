# CMS editor component
A CMS (Content Management System) editor is a user-friendly tool that allows translators to efficiently translate website content using a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) web editor. This tool enables multiple translators to collaborate and work on translations simultaneously. Users can export all translated content into a zip file, simplifying the process of managing and distributing translated CMS files.
